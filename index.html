        <p>Hello everyone this is Raihaan and i'm sharing my bucket list with you all here..
            <br><br>I know the summer season is yet to come and im excited as well to let you know ill be going on a trip and visting the Country and its rich heritage. i have quiet a few things on my bucket list starting with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving" target="_blank">Scuba Diving</a> i was pretty mesmerized when i see people on the television exploring the deep water-bodies and was wishing to explore them one day as well.
        <br><br> Next item on my bucket list is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachuting" target="_blank">Parachuting</a> this will be among one of the most awesome experience i will ever have. its just fascinating how people seem to make it so easy and simple to jump off a flying plane and open the parachute when they're about to reach the ground.
    <br><br> And, here's the one i was wanting to try from when i was a child and this is not going to be the dream anymore! A trip to <a href="https://www.thrillophilia.com/road-trip-to-ladakh" target="_blank">Ladakh</a>. One of my fav thing is to travel it by bike... and the list is never-ending.</p>
